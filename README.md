# Open-Hame RestAPI client
## Instalation
Project is developed using external JS libraries and doesn't need any additional setup.
All further external scripts should be added using CDN links.

In order for some JS packages to work (Axios), webpage should be served by any server.
For development purpose I recommend running python simple web server.
```
python -m http.server 8000
```
for windows
after visiting localhost:8000 u can navigate to index.html


## Libraries used
- Vue.JS - Main JS foundation framework
- Axios - HTTP Requests client
- Lodash - Helper library for JS
